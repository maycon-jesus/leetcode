# 3531. Count Covered Buildings

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topics:** Array, Hash Table, Sorting
**Status:** Attempted

## Problem Description

You are given a positive integer `n`, representing an `n x n` city. You are also given a 2D grid `buildings`, where `buildings[i] = [x, y]` denotes a unique building located at coordinates `[x, y]`.

A building is **covered** if there is at least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below.

Return the number of covered buildings.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2],[2,1],[2,3]]
Output: 1
```

**Explanation:**
- Only building `[2,2]` is covered as it has at least one building:
  - above: `[1,2]`
  - below: `[3,2]`
  - left: `[2,1]`
  - right: `[2,3]`
- Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 0
```

**Explanation:**
- No building has at least one building in all four directions.

### Example 3

```
Input: n = 5, buildings = [[1,3],[3,2],[3,3],[3,5],[5,3]]
Output: 1
```

**Explanation:**
- Only building `[3,3]` is covered as it has at least one building:
  - above: `[1,3]`
  - below: `[5,3]`
  - left: `[3,2]`
  - right: `[3,5]`
- Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= buildings.length <= 10^5`
- `buildings[i] = [x, y]`
- `1 <= x, y <= n`
- All coordinates of buildings are unique.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Use a Hash Set:** Store all building coordinates in a hash set for O(1) lookup time.

2. **Check Each Building:** For each building at position `[x, y]`, check if there exists at least one building in all four directions:
   - **Left:** Any building with coordinates `[x, y']` where `y' < y`
   - **Right:** Any building with coordinates `[x, y']` where `y' > y`
   - **Above:** Any building with coordinates `[x', y]` where `x' < x`
   - **Below:** Any building with coordinates `[x', y]` where `x' > x`

3. **Optimize Direction Checking:** Instead of checking all possible positions, we can:
   - Group buildings by row (same x-coordinate) to check left/right
   - Group buildings by column (same y-coordinate) to check above/below

4. **Count Covered Buildings:** Increment the counter for each building that satisfies all four direction conditions.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(m²) where m is the number of buildings
  - In the worst case, we need to check all buildings for each building
  - With optimization using maps: O(m) average case

- **Space Complexity:** O(m)
  - Storage for the hash set and auxiliary maps
